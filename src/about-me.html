            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>
            Hi, I'm Jenny Christie <img src="Images/Jenny-photo-edited.jpg" width="50%" style="float:right; padding:15px;" alt="photo"/>
            </p>
            <p>
            I'm passionate about helping people find their way through their problems and enabling them to thrive.
            </p>
            <p>
            I trained as a clinical hypnotherapist with the New Zealand School of Professional Hypnotherapy in 2015. I have a Diploma in Clinical and Advanced Hypnosis and am a Certified Anxiety Specialist and Certified Practitioner of Neurolinguistic Programming (NLP).
            </p>
            <p>
            I love seeing the positive change that hypnotherapy can bring to people's lives.
            </p>
            <p>
            As a hypnotherapist I am fortunate to be able to help clients identify and change the unconscious thought patterns that are limiting them. Much of what we experience is due to the way events or circumstances are filtered or interpreted by our unconscious mind. This process occurs outside our conscious awareness. Some hidden thought patterns are unhelpful and can trap us in ways of being or behaving that prevent us leading a full and rewarding life. By enabling my clients to engage directly with their unconscious mind, hypnotherapy allows them to modify the thought processes occurring there and establish more constructive automatic responses and habits
            </p>  
            <p> 
                For some, life is a journey of opportunity and adventure, but for many of us there are at least some periods when the journey is plagued by frustration, anxiety and sometimes despair, and we need support to find our way and overcome limiting thought patterns. Supporting people to be able to go forward with confidence and optimism is something I am passionate about.
            </p>  
            <p>
            I am fascinated by people's behaviours, perspectives and approaches to life, and by the way they respond to situations they find themselves in. What I love about hypnotherapy is that it enables people to take more control over their lives by identifying and changing some of their unwanted automatic patterns. My goal as a hypnotherapist is to support my clients to free themselves from unhelpful subconscious beliefs and find their way to a more positive and fulfilling journey through life.

            <h2> My philosophy: my approach to therapy</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The universality of being human - we are all interconnected to each other and to the wider world, and supporting each other's well-being helps us all.</li>
                <li>There is something valuable and precious inside everyone.</li>
                <li>People are nearly always trying to do the best they can in the circumstances.</li>
                <li>Even bad habits have some good in them.</li>
                <li>If a person seeks help, they know what the problem is, even if they don't know how to change it.</li>
                <li>Every challenge provides an opportunity for growth or deeper understanding.</li> 
                <li>Everyone has their own personal journey through life, their own challenges, their own inner resources, and their own choices to make. It is the journey that matters, and as the psychologist Carl Rogers said of life, "it is always a process of becoming".</li>
            </ul>
