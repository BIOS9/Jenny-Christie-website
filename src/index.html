            <h2>Hypnotherapy for the thoughts and behaviours you want to change</h2>
            <p>Every individual is unique, each with our own amazing qualities and potentials. But sometimes we lose sight of who we really are. Each of us sometimes feels stuck or lost in a murky cloud of confusion or worry, as if some aspects of life are just too hard, too stressful or too out-of-control to deal with. If such feelings go on too long, they can impact on our emotional, social or physical health.
            </p>
            <p>I can help you get beyond the confusion and see issues clearly. Through hypnotherapy you will accesses the resources of your subconscious mind to help you recognise your strengths and abilities, and clear away things that are blocking progress, obscuring your path or weighing you down. As a hypnotherapist I can help you find your way, and support you in moving forward.
            </p>
            <p>Hypnotherapy can be used for a wide range of unwanted emotional and behavioural patterns including problems such as anxiety, depression, phobias, addictions and anger.

                    <h3>Stress, anxiety, fear</h3>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        Everyone experiences occasional stress, anxiety and fear. These are normal healthy responses to threatening situations, which spur us to take action to keep ourselves safe.                            However, sometimes the 'threat' is ongoing, perhaps a situation that we feel powerless to change, or feelings relating to a traumatic experience in the past.
                    </p> 
                    <p class="card-text">
                        Ongoing or excessive stress or anxiety is uncomfortable and exhausting. It can be very difficult to live with, impacting on our physical, emotional and mental health.
                    </p> 
                    <p class="card-text">
                        Using hypnotherapy, I can help you take control of your emotional responses. While you are in a state of deep, calming relaxation, your subconscious mind can examine the issues and their underlying causes in a safe way. I will guide you to identify any links between your current problems and traumatic experiences in the past. I can then help you to recognise and release any powerful emotional connections that are currently making you respond to particular situations in an unhelpful way. This means that in future, when you face similar situations, you will be able to deal with them much more easily without bringing in old patterns that are no longer helpful. Hypnotherapy can also help you develop and embed coping strategies so that you do not feel overwhelmed, and can stay relaxed and calm when facing challenging situations in the future.

                    <h3>Self-identity, self-confidence, defining who you are</h3>
                   
                    <p class="card-text">
                        Our perception of ourselves and our place in the world affects how we experience situations and how we react to them. It is closely linked to our personality, our confidence and self-esteem, and also to our abilty to pursue our goals and ambitions. It is something we have learned over time, but sometimes it is not serving us as well as it should.
                    </p> 
                    <p class="card-text">  
                        Particularly as we are growing up, we are constantly getting messages about other people's expectations of us, how we ought to think, feel, and behave, what our goals should be - and about how well we are measuring up against those expectations. Unconsciously we often adopt many of those expectations as the framework upon which we build our own identity, but sometimes the framework is too rigid or does not provide the support we need for our own personality to develop comfortably and confidently.
                    </p> 
                    <p class="card-text">    
                        Like any learned thought pattern, our perception of our self and of our place in the world can be modified. 
                    </p> 
                    <p class="card-text">   
                        Hypnotherapy can help you identify your strengths and values, reduce anxiety about particular situations you find difficult, and change the subconscious thought patterns that stop you engaging with the world in a relaxed and confident way. Instead of those limiting patterns, you can learn to recognise the real you, the confident you, with the potential to be all you can be.

                        Is life grey, lacking in joy and optimism?
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        We all occasionally encounter difficult times, when just keeping going seems unbearably hard. If such times are temporary, they develop our coping skills, and we come out of them a little stronger, a little wiser and ready for the next challenge. But sometimes, we may find ourselves stuck in the darkness for so long we wonder if we can ever be happy again. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        Hypnotherapy can help you identify the issues, bring some light into the darkness and develop a positive way forward into a life where joy and optimism flourish

                    <h3>Loss, Grief</h3>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        The sorrow of loss and grief can cause deep pain, and sometimes the pain feels so overwhelming that it seems impossible that you could get past it. Inevitably, loss is part of life, part of the ongoing process of change that also supports growth and makes room for renewal. When you lose someone you love, or deal with any other major transition involving a significant loss, there is a necessary grieving process before you can move on, and for a while the pain may feel beyond words, too huge to understand or express, too huge to deal with.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        Hypnotherapy can help you find your way through the grief, looking at it in different ways, gently dealing with different aspects of it, and gradually letting yourself reopen to live a full life.
